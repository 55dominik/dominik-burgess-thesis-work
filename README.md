________________________________________________________

1: Build or use pre-built Raspberry Pi app APK file

	Build the APK file of the Raspberry Pi application using android studio.
  
     OR
     
	Use the "rpi-app.apk" file found in "apk files" folder.
  

________________________________________________________
2: Create Android things image file

	Go to "https://partner.android.com/things/console"
	Log in using a google account (required)
	"Add product" - Choose "Raspberry Pi 3" from the dropdown menu
	Click on newly created model
	Click on "New" -> "Start from scratch"
	Type a name for the build configuration, click "Next"
	Choose version then click "Next" (last tested version:
				OS build: OIM1.180327.097
				OS version: 1.0.15.5796897
				Patch level: 20190801
				Date uploaded: Aug 16, 2019)
	"Add an app" -> upload the "rpi-app.apk" file and select, then click "Next"
		(ensure Google Play Services apk is added)
	Click "Next" and leave default selections
	Click "Create Build"

_______________________________________________________
3: Intall the iso file on the Raspberry Pi

	Download the build configuration you created in step 2
	Download the Android Things setup utility 
		(found: "https://partner.android.com/things/console/u/0/#/tools")
	Run the setup utility:
		"1 - Install Android THings and optionally set up Wi-Fi"
		Type 1 then [Enter]

		"1 - Raspberry Pi 3"
		Type 1 then [Enter]

		"2 - Custom image..."
		Type 2 then [Enter]

		Copy the path of the downloaded .zip file containing the image
		Plug in the SD card to install the image on

		Follow the remaining steps to set up wifi on the Raspberry Pi OR
		  use an ethernet cable instead (ensure wifi/ethernet networks are private networks).
	Plug SD card into Raspberry Pi and power on.
